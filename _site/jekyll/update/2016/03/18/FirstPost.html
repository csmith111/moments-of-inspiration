    <p>We have all experienced moments in our life when we feel inspired. These are moments when we feel that life is worth living and we have found another reason to do so, These <strong>moments</strong>, triggered by a piece of music, writing, poetry or a picture, we have an so many sources of inspiration.</p>

<p>Our lives are so precariously balanced, between the infinities. In space between the infinity of the largeness of the cosmos and the infinity of the smallness of the subatomic world. In time, between the infinity of the past and the infinity of the future. Now as a scientist I know that these are not really infinite, we know that for example the infinity of the past is about 14 billion years and that the infinity of the size of the observable universe is actually 46 billion light-years. In life I have found great inspiration in understanding these questions and the amazing story of how we have discovered all this. This self aware and replicating carbon based life form that we can homo-sapiens has been able to comprehend so much, and yet there are so many “limits” to our understanding. As we comprehend the size and scale of all that lies around us, and experience life, realize how brief it is I realize that we desperately need inspiration in all the different forms that we find it to inspire us to keep going. To find hidden meaning and purpose in everything that surrounds us.</p>

<p>In this blog I will capture some of my moments of inspiration.
I would love to discover some of your <strong>moments</strong> of inspiration.</p>
