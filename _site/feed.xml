        <title>Why aren&#39;t things the way they should be?</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-arent-things-the-way-they-should-be&quot;&gt;Why aren’t things the way they should be?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges that we can face in life is reconciling the difference between the way things are and the way things should be. Often, we are clever enough to visualize the way things should be. This leads to immense frustration with the way things are. I have had to deal with this situation often and I am still dealing with this situation all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two techniques that I found effective in dealing with this situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” - M. K. Ghandhi&lt;/strong&gt;
This is an extremely challenging response to the situation. Leading by example and living your life/doing things the way they should be done is an extremely good way to channel your frustration. In this way you are concentrating your energies into creating/planning/working on the change that you want to see, rather than giving vent to your frustrations or doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.” - The Serenity Prayer&lt;/strong&gt;
I used to carry these words around with me  and always kept a copy on my desk. It is clear and simple message for how to deal with many situations in your life. Read it and reflect on the wisdom in those lines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living life on your own terms, not accepting the status quo and being true to your core values is what makes life worth living. So do not be daunted by the magnitude of the change that needs to happen.
&lt;strong&gt;“A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step”  - Tao Te Ching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things-to-do&quot;&gt;Things to do:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take the time to think about your life and see if some of the conflict and stress you face is because of the difference between the way things are and the way they should be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about what you could do to become the “change you seek”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a plan and take some active steps to create the change we make your world “the way it should be”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue with your mindfulness practice so you can choose your response in the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Choices</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Between the stimulus and the response there is a moment, between action and reaction there is a moment, it is in this moment that our entire life is played out. The choices that we make for our responses in those moments define our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that this moment is all important, why can’t we just make good choices and be in control of our responses? 
There are many answers to this question. Let us focus on one aspect of this of the answer to this question, the deep biological reasons for our responses. The immediate response that we have especially in stressful/unusual/unplanned situations is governed by the amygdala. This is a primitive part of our human brain that governs our instinctive responses. This part of  the brain was built to react to danger and responds with a “flight or fight” response, which is not optimal. The frontal cortex which is the thinking part of our brain only gets to react a fraction of a second later. We would respond better to situations if we could leverage the frontal cortex of our brain. But we fail to do so because of our biology. So if we want to conquer our responses what can we do, are we helpless? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start, let us begin by realizing that controlling our responses is the single most important art that we can try to master. Think of a few things that you could achieve once you have mastery over your self and your responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are three practical things we can do to improve the way we respond to situations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anticipation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meditation&quot;&gt;Meditation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will write more about meditation in another note. It is becoming clear to us that meditation, the art of mindfulness  is an important aspect of our lives and a skill that we must cultivate. As you have experienced there is an “observer” in our minds that seems to watch our actions and thoughts. This is the deeper inner self, that gives each one of us the sense of “I am”. The meditation that I am taking about is taking 5 minutes a day and becoming aware of becoming aware of your self. Observing your thoughts as they arise, and centering your mind back on being aware of yourself.
 
Please try this:
Here is a guided meditation that you can try:&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=422n7tzAxEI&quot;&gt;this guided meditation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can look at articles and talks by Kabat Zinn like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nwwKbM_vJc&quot;&gt;talk at Google: Mindfullness with Jon Kabat-Zinn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or this one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeCXhXDkzpw&quot;&gt;Mindfullness - An Introduction&lt;/a&gt;
After trying this daily for a couple of weeks, I would love to hear your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anticipation&quot;&gt;Anticipation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be able to anticipate the situations that we will be put into and think about how we are going to respond. Later we need to reflect on what happened and see how effective our anticipation was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did the situation arise as we had anticipated?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did we respond as we planned? If yes, then you need to be very proud of yourself. Otherwise, you need to think about why you responded the way you did.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did something happen that you did not anticipate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;training&quot;&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coupled with anticipation, is the notion of training. We need to practice situations that we can face and practice our responses. The simplest optimal response to a stressful/unplanned situation is to say “Let me think about that and get back to you”. This will break the normal sequence and give you time to choose your response. Make the time to think about the situation and choose your response. Be positive, cooperative and constructive in your response.
Once we have chosen this path of action include a reflection on a daily basis to see if your training has resulted the changes in behavior that you need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Was I in situation that I had been training for? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did I respond the way I trained? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If not why not?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I need to add something to my training?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the subject of training, there is a lot more training that we can do, to make sure that when we respond we are responding optimally. We will explore this more in the coming notes.
 
Just by reading this you have started your journey on a path to fulfilling your potential and being a happier person and achieving your goals.  
“A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step…” I hope that you will take these first steps.. I look forward to being part of your journey.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Moments of Inspiration</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We have all experienced moments in our life when we feel inspired. These are moments when we feel that life is worth living and we have found another reason for this. These &lt;strong&gt;moments&lt;/strong&gt;, triggered by a piece of music, writing, poetry or a picture are moments that we need to treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lives are so precariously balanced, between the infinities. In space, between the infinity of the largeness of the cosmos and the infinity of the smallness of the subatomic world. In time, between the infinity of the past and the infinity of the future. Now as a scientist, I know that these are not really infinite. We know, for example, the infinity of the past is about 14 billion years and that the infinity of the size of the observable universe is actually 46 billion light-years. In my life I have found great inspiration in understanding these questions. And unravelling the amazing stories of how we have discovered all this. While it is amazing that this self aware and replicating carbon based life form that we can homo-sapiens has been able to comprehend so much it is also true that there are so many “limits” to our understanding. As we uncover the mysteries in all that lies around us, and experience life, we also realize how brief life is. This can be something that is very depressing. We desperately need inspiration in all the different forms that we can find it it in. Inspiration to to keep us going, to find hidden meaning, structure and purpose in everything that surrounds us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog I will capture some of my moments of inspiration.
I would love to discover some of your &lt;strong&gt;moments&lt;/strong&gt; of inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WHEN</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN&lt;/strong&gt; I have emptied my soul, I am full of life &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WHEN&lt;/strong&gt; I am most alone, I am connected to all &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WHEN&lt;/strong&gt; I have faced my biggest fears, I am most calm &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WHEN&lt;/strong&gt; I recognize my ignorance, I discover deeper knowledge &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WHEN&lt;/strong&gt;  I have lost my identity, I finally discover who I am &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WHEN&lt;/strong&gt; I weather the storms of grief, I discover an oasis of tranquility &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WHEN&lt;/strong&gt; I experience the burning ache of sorrow, I have known the bliss of love &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WHEN&lt;/strong&gt; I am shrouded by silence, I hear the music I could never hear before &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WHEN&lt;/strong&gt; I am most wretched, I am touched by grace &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WHEN&lt;/strong&gt; I have finished my struggles, I will know peace&lt;/p&gt;
