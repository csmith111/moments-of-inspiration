We have all experienced moments in our life when we feel inspired. These are moments when we feel that life is worth living and we have found another reason for this. These __moments__, triggered by a piece of music, writing, poetry or a picture are moments that we need to treasure.

Our lives are so precariously balanced, between the infinities. In space, between the infinity of the largeness of the cosmos and the infinity of the smallness of the subatomic world. In time, between the infinity of the past and the infinity of the future. Now as a scientist, I know that these are not really infinite. We know, for example, the infinity of the past is about 14 billion years and that the infinity of the size of the observable universe is actually 46 billion light-years. In my life I have found great inspiration in understanding these questions. And unravelling the amazing stories of how we have discovered all this. While it is amazing that this self aware and replicating carbon based life form that we can homo-sapiens has been able to comprehend so much it is also true that there are so many "limits" to our understanding. As we uncover the mysteries in all that lies around us, and experience life, we also realize how brief life is. This can be something that is very depressing. We desperately need inspiration in all the different forms that we can find it it in. Inspiration to to keep us going, to find hidden meaning, structure and purpose in everything that surrounds us.


In this blog I will capture some of my moments of inspiration.
I would love to discover some of your __moments__ of inspiration.
