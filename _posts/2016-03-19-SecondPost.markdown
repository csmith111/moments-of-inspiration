__WHEN__ I have emptied my soul, I am full of life \\
__WHEN__ I am most alone, I am connected to all \\
__WHEN__ I have faced my biggest fears, I am most calm \\
__WHEN__ I recognize my ignorance, I discover deeper knowledge \\
__WHEN__ I have no identity, I finally discover who I am \\
__WHEN__ I weather the storms of grief, I discover an oasis of tranquility \\
__WHEN__ I experience the burning ache of sorrow, I have known the bliss of love \\
__WHEN__ I am shrouded by silence, I hear the music I could never hear before \\
__WHEN__ I am most wretched, I am touched by grace \\
__WHEN__ I have finished my struggles, I will know peace \\
