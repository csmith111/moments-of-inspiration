__Don't work too hard, express your feelings, keep in touch with your friends, let yourself be happier and live the life that is true to yourself.__

If you can do this you will reduce/eliminate the top 5 regrets that people have at the end of their lives.

Here are some concrete steps that you can take to lead a more fulfilling life.

* Take some time reflect on your life and see if you currently have any of these regrets.
* Make a resolution to incorporate these elements into your life.
* Create a plan that actively incorporates these elements into your daily life.
* What concrete metrics can you use to measure your progress?
* Periodically review how you are doing by evaluating your metrics.



This post is based on the book by Bronnie Ware, The Top Five Regrets of the dying.
Here is the list:

1. I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
2. I wish I hadn’t worked so hard.
3. I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings.
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish that I had let myself be happier.
