__Why?__ Asking this simple question in different contexts and having the tenacity to keep asking this question until you get a good answer is the key to unlocking your full potential and achieving success.

Tell me about yourself. Go on... Now reflect on your reply.
Almost always, we tend to hear people tell us __"What they do"__. There are few who talk about __why__ they do __what__ they do.

Perhaps you have heard the story of Christopher Wren, one of the greatest of English architects, who walked one day unrecognized among the men who were at work upon the building of St. Paul's cathedral in London which he had designed. "What are you doing?" he inquired of one of the workmen, and the man replied, "I am cutting a piece of stone." As he went on he put the same question to another man, and the man replied, "I am earning five shillings twopence a day." And to a third man he addressed the same inquiry and the man answered, "I am helping Sir Christopher Wren build a beautiful cathedral." That man had vision. He could see beyond the cutting of the stone, beyond the earning of his daily wage, to the creation of a work of artâ€”the building of a great cathedral. And in your life it is important for you to strive to attain a vision of the larger whole. (Also attributed to Louise Bush-Brown, director of the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture for Women.)[Link to wikiquote][wikiquoteCW]

As you can see this person who could talk about the WHY was clear more inspiring to us, and he probably lead a more fulfilled and satisfied life.


__Things to do:__

* Take a moment to apply the question WHY? To your life.
    * Are you someone who always asks this question? Have you given up on asking the question?
* Commit to asking __Why?__ more often in your life. 
* Apply this question to a few activities in your life. Why am I doing this Project? Why am I learning this subject? Why am I working in this job?
* After a week reflect on the changes that you experience.
* Use the WHYs in your communication to others. Tell them about the cathedrals you are building or you want to build in your life.

The answers will be difficult and sometimes even seem impossible to find. __Remember__ finding answers to the __WHYs__ in your life is what makes life worth living.
