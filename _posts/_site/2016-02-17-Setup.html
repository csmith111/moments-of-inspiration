<p>In this section we will look at how to set up the development environment for developing Web applications.</p>

<p>We were living in a nice little bubble where we could basically use <a href="http://elm-lang.org/try">online editor/runner.</a> and avoid a local install.</p>

<p>But once you need to start writing real web applications you will need a local install of Elm as well as other packages to support web development.</p>

<h3 id="installing-elm">Installing Elm</h3>
<p>Essentially I found the <a href="http://elm-lang.org/install">Elm install instructions</a> to be fairly complete and adequate. So I will just point you to that. I am using Atom currently and find the setup for Elm quite ok. I will add some instruction of how to customize atom so you can interact with the repl.</p>

<h3 id="hosting-your-web-applications">Hosting your Web Applications</h3>
<p>We will look at two hosting scenarios for your app :</p>

<h3 id="elm-live">Elm live</h3>

<p>You will find all the documentation you need for the setup of Elm live at the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-live">node package site for elm-live</a> or on the <a href="https://github.com/tomekwi/elm-live">elm-live GitHub site</a>.</p>

<p>As you run through the install process you will find that Elm has a remarkably polite and communicative package manager.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="gp">$ </span>mkdir TestApp <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">cd </span>TestApp

-- you need this only <span class="k">if </span>want to install elm locally
<span class="gp">$ </span>elm package install

-- This will install the html libraries and its dependencies.
<span class="gp">$ </span>elm package install evancz/elm-html

-- <span class="k">for </span>some projects we will use the start-app package you can get it by
<span class="gp">$ </span>elm package install evancz/start-app</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now if you create a file <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.elm</code></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nn">Html</span>
<span class="n">main</span> <span class="o">=</span>
   <span class="kt">Html</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">text</span> <span class="s">"Hello, World!"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can now run your file through elm-live by:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="gp">$ </span>elm-live main.elm --open</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="cp">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"/style.css"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/elm.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="gp">$ </span>elm-live Main.elm --output<span class="o">=</span>elm.js --open</code></pre></figure>

<p>You should be good to go.</p>

<p>The output to the console will tell you where you can point the browser to see your page.
If you use the defaults I found that it points to:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">http://192.168.1.113:8000/</code></p>

<p>Now fire up you editor you should see your webpage. Make a change to main.elm to see the page update as soon as you save it.</p>

<h3 id="elm-reactor">Elm Reactor</h3>

<p>Reactor comes with the Elm platform. So you can pretty much use it as soon as you have elm installed. You will find more information on the [Elm Reactor GitHub site]:<a href="https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor">Elm-Reactor</a>.</p>

<p>Just navigate to your project folder and on the command line run:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">$ elm-reactor</code>. You should see the elm reactor running at
<code class="highlighter-rouge">http://0.0.0.0:8000/</code> which is the default. If for some reason this does not work you might want to try two things to trouble shoot this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure that any firewall you are running is not blocking access to this port.</li>
  <li>Also you can just try changing the port using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-post</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-address</code> options as described on the <a href="https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor">Elm Reactor GitHub site</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Elm reactor also has a built in Debugger that we will discuss in a later post on Debugging.</p>
