__Why do you seek to join Teach For America?__

I have been a life long learner and I have acquired the techniques to enable me to enjoy and pursue excellence in any field that I have chosen. Today, I speak 6 languages; I have a deep understanding of technology (can program in about 10 programming languages), I have a doctorate in physics, play music (guitar and sing tenor in the choir), I am active in sports (tennis, chess, volleyball) and I continue to be to enjoy learning and sharing my passion for learning every day.

I was able to do much of this without access to many good teachers and good resources (books/internet). This is a circumstance in my life that that I deeply regret. (It has taken me great pain, determination and effort to achieve my many of my goals and I have had to do this in isolation.) I always wished that I had access to more good teachers. Now that I have achieved all the personal and financial success that I need, I would like to devote my efforts to helping students discover the joy of learning and showing students how they too can pursue excellence while using my knowledge and experience to make their journey easier. I consider mathematics and science to be subjects that not only provide a student with enjoyment and understanding about the world we live in, but also subjects that give us insight into how we learn. This insight into how to learn has allowed me to successfully transfer the skill of learning to many other fields (like learning software engineering when I changed careers from physics to technology or learning Italian while I was living in Italy). I would like to motivate my students to pursue excellence, help my students to define their goals and give them the knowledge and training to achieve them.

As a technologist I see that we are at a great moment in the history of humanity when a student of today has access to more computing power and information than ever before in history.  This gives the teacher and the student access to new learning experiences and tools that can be used to improve learning and create more understanding and I am eager to put these new technologies to use.

As a society we face numerous difficult problems, like finding a cure for cancer or heart disease, controlling the damage to the environment etc. Meeting these challenges are essential to our existence and our hope for success rests in the new generation of students. I would like to help foster and develop the next generation of skilled, talented and motivated students.

Through out my life I have been working on the ability to communicate and teach effectively. Beginning with being a successful speaker and debator in my school and college days, to being an effective lecturer during my research days, to becoming an effective speaker and facilitator and teacher/trainer during my corporate career and working as a successful volunteer tutor I have continuously developed my communication skills and it has contributed enormously to my success.


__As you know, our corps members teach in predominantly low-income communities.
What experiences (in life, work, volunteering, etc.)
have you had that could inform your success teaching in low-income communities?__

I grew up in a third world country in a neighborhood located in the midst of low income communities. I went to a school that had a large mix of students from low income communities. So, I have first hand experience of the challenges faced by students of low income communities.

In the last five years I have spent time tutoring students from low income neighborhoods
as a volunteer from the Starfish program and also working as a budget coach for WBDC in Stamford.
These experiences have given me further insights in to the challenges faced by students from low income communities and possible techniques/solutions to meet these challenges.

Here I will briefly discuss three issues that I have found, and  the approach that I have taken to help my students:

* __Motivation and inspiration is essential__ Since these students face numerous challenges and distractions, I find the most important ingredient for success is motivation and inspiration. So, I take time and effort to find ways to provide motivation and inspiration for these students. Within the purview of the subject that I am teaching I look for inspiring stories, anecdotes and powerful images/data (like the size of the universe/the smallness of an atom/the speed of light) and share them with the student. I have found that organizing material in a manner that leads students from one moment of discovery/insight to another enables me to keep the students motivated. I also work on enabling students to see quizzes and tests as opportunities to succeed rather than possible moments of failure. Test/quizzes are introduced as a means of obtaining nonjudgemental feedback that will help students improve their skill and understanding rapidly.

* __Lack of role models__ Students from low income neighborhoods often lack role models to help them see how they can become successful. Trying to introduce them to role models in the public arena and enabling students to find role models in the public arena and a mentors within their community is a powerful tool to enable students to become successful.

* __The Culture of appreciation for learning is missing__ Students are lacking a cultural background that instills an appreciation of learning in them. A child surrounded by a family with a love for sports is very likely to develop an appreciation for sports. A similar environment with a love for learning is missing. So, an appreciation of the structured effort and diligent practice required to master a subject is missing. And without this appreciation a deep respect and admiration for their teachers, parents and other members of society who have achieved mastery is missing. This also means that the drive to acquire learning is weaker in these students and their relationship, respect and value for teachers, elders and mentors is adversely affected. I do not have a clear solution to this problem, I have tried to engage parents and mentors by doing joint sessions where they work together to solve problems so they can develop a joint appreciation for learning and this has provided some benefit to my students.

* __Describe your most meaningful accomplishment within the past 4-5 years.
  What did you accomplish?
  How would you measure your success?
  Why was this accomplishment particularly important to you?
  What were the greatest challenges or roadblocks you faced?
  To what do you attribute your success?__

I have had numerous accomplishments in the last five years here I will list a couple :
__Leadership accomplishments__ Leading the Corporate functions technology team at CIT, leading a team of about hundred people and a budget of 20 million dollars. Collaborating with senior stakeholders (CFO, CRO, COO, CIO and the head of HR) and developing a shared vision for Enterprise technology and leading a team to deliver on strategic initiatives.  

__Learning accomplishments:__
  * Completed courses in Data science, and studied Artificial intelligence and machine Learning. I have developed a good understanding of the mathematical techniques and the application of these techniques to solve several interesting problems.
  * I have acquired proficiency in new programming languages like R and Python(for data science and teaching computer programming) and Haskell and Elm for functional programming.
  * Developed and understanding of Finance and accounting, and enterprise accounting procedures and practices. Leveraged this understanding to lead a technology team to working on delivering a strategic finance transformation program at CIT.


I would attribute my successes to some of my strengths that I have developed over time:
* __Leadership__ In the last 10 years of my career in finance I have had to display strong leadership skills when leading large teams (50-100 people) through one of the greatest recessions of our times. I have been able to do this by developing a leadership style based on:
  * Displaying a positive can do attitude
  * Building shared team/group values and making decisions based on them
  * Focussing on continuous learning and development
  * Leading by example
  * Encouraging excellence
  * Fostering innovation
  * Respect and value for

* __Communication__ Through out my life I have been working on the ability to communicate effectively. Beginning with being a successful speaker and debator in my school and college days, to being an effective lecturer during my research days and eventually becoming an effective speaker and facilitator and teacher/trainer during my corporate career I have continuously developed my communication skills and it has contributed enormously to my success.

* __Effective Learning__ I have an established track record of that demonstrates the ability to learn effectively. This has enabled me to take up activities in new areas and quickly become an expert who is able to contribute effectively and produce innovative new ideas.  I have been a lifelong learner and take great pleasure in discovering and mastering new fields.

* Developing the ability to go to have a broad range of interests and develop a appreciation for the intricacies of these different fields; to keep the big picture in mind while devoting time and effort to master details at the same time.  This ability to look at many subject from different perspectives has given me numerous insights that have enabled me to make critical decisions and lead many successful projects during my career.

* I bring a lot of __passion and dedication__ to my work and this has contributed largely to my success. This has also contributed to enabling me to be a good leader, often leading and inspiring by example.
