# Music - The building blocks

First of all we start by building up an understanding of what music is.
We will do this by first deconstructing music into its elements and then
building back the structure of music.

First let us look at a single _tone_ in music.
The fundamental components of a single _tone_ in music are:

* Pitch
* Volume
* Duration
* Reverberation
* Timbre

For groups of notes we can also define:

* Scale
* Tempo
* Meter

## The Tone
We have all heard it and said "music is made up of notes"

In these article we will make a distinction between __notes__ and __tones__.  

__Note__ a single unit of sound in written music.

__Tone__ a single unit of sound  in the music we hear.

We introduce note when we encounter written music, until then we will only
refer to tones.

## Pitch
Everything that we recognize as sound is made up of vibrations. If we pluck a
string on an acoustic instrument the air around it is compressed and decompressed.
These changes in pressure of the air travels through the air and reaches our ear
which we then hear as music.

Before we proceed a definition.
__Frequency__ The number of vibrations/second that a string makes is called its
frequency. The unit that we use is call the Hertz (Hz) defined after Heinrich
Hertz who among other things made the first radio transmitter.
So where can we see the use of this definition in music? Every tone has a
frequency. So when we pluck the string of a tuned guitar the first string (E)
vibrates at a frequency of 329.63 Hz.
