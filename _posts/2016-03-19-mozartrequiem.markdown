# Music - The building blocks

We will start by building up an understanding of what music is.
by deconstructing music into its elements and then
build up the structure of music.

First let us look at a single _tone_ in music.
The fundamental components of a single _tone_ in music are:

* Pitch
* Volume
* Duration
* Reverberation
* Timbre

For groups of notes we can also define:

* Scale
* Tempo
* Meter

## The Tone
We have all heard it and said "music is made up of notes". Later we will get more abstract and talk about music being about "music is about the spaces between the notes". But first let us understand the notes.

In these articles we will make a distinction between __notes__ and __tones__. __Note__ a single unit of sound in written music. __Tone__ a single unit of sound  in the music we hear.

We introduce notes when we encounter written music; until then we will only refer to tones.

## Pitch
Everything that we recognize as sound is made up of vibrations. If we pluck a
string on an acoustic instrument the air around it is compressed and decompressed.
These changes in pressure of the air travels through the air and reaches our ear and causes the ear drum to vibrate. This vibration is then converted into electrical signals that are carried to the brain which then interprets the signal as a sound! The brain then recognizes that the tone has a particular pitch and for the trained musician you can even recognize the actual frequency of the tone! Isn't it amazing to think that all this (and more) happens when I pluck a string and you hear the tone!

Before we proceed a definition.

__Frequency__ The number of vibrations/second that a string makes is called its
frequency. The unit that we use is call the Hertz (Hz) defined after Heinrich
Hertz who among other things made the first radio transmitter.
So where can we see the use of this definition in music? Every tone has a
frequency. So when we pluck the string of a tuned guitar the first string (E) vibrates at a frequency of 329.63 Hz. And when we strike a piano the middle A vibrates at a frequency of 440 Hz.

We cannot hear all the sounds that can be produced, the ear is able to hear sounds that have frequencies in the range 20Hz - 20,000 Hz.
