#Music - The building blocks

First of all we start bu building up an understanding of what music is.
We will do this by first deconstructing music into its elements and then
building back the structure of music.

First let us look at a single _tone_ in music.
The fundamentals components of a single _tone_ music are:
* Tone
* Pitch
* Volume
* Duration
* Reverberation
* Timbre

For groups of notes we can also define:
* Scale
* Tempo
* Meter

## The Tone
We have all heard it and said "music is made up of notes"

In these article we will make a distinction between __notes__ and __tones__.  

__Note__ a single unit of sound in written music.

__Tone__ a single unit of sound  in the music we hear.

We introduce note when we encounter written music, until then we will only
refer to tones.
