__We do not interact with the world directly; instead we interact with reality as reflected by our mental model of the world.__

Please take a moment to think about this statement. Our instinct is to say this is not true.  How can it be?

Let me illustrate with an example. I was in a meeting and a co-worker was interrupting the meeting by knocking on the door and insisting on getting our attention.  Even though we tried to ignore her, she was insistent and disruptive.

__Would you be annoyed in such a situation?__

Now, what if I told you that she had a received an urgent call from the hospital where her baby was sick? And she was trying to get your attention to tell you that she had to leave and give you  some essential information you needed for a meeting before she left?

__Would you be annoyed now?__

What changed in the world outside that caused you to have a different response?

The situation was a the same, someone was interrupting your meeting. But your mental model was different. Your mental picture of the person who was interrupting the meeting was different.

Things to do:
	1) Think of situations where you have felt strong emotions. Now reflect whether you could have changed your response by changing your mental model.
	2) Reflect on whether  you could affect your relationship with yourself and with others by changing your mental model.
Think of how effective it can be to change your mental model and by doing this change your responses to different situations.
