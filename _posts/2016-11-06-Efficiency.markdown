This morning I was watching the NY city marathon, and marveling at the efficiency of the leading marathon runners. Of all the life forms on the planet we the human beings are outstanding running machines. We may not be as fast as cheetah or even a horse, but we can outrun them! Our ability to keep ourselves cool and fuel ourselves by tapping our fat sources is so amazing that we run further that most animals on the planet!

Anyway, all this thinking about efficiency lead me to write this note about how we can take inspiration from the dedication to training and efficiency of the marathon runner into all aspects of our lives.
Before we start to do think about efficiency I want to encourage you think about efficiency vs effectiveness.

__Efficiency is Doing things Right
Effectiveness is Doing the Right things__

Today we will focus on efficiency. In the next post we will look at effectiveness.

### Efficiency
How efficient are you in all the activities you pursue? Consider that if you have not spent a lot of time thinking about this, you could easily improve your performance tenfold. (10X your performance.) Think about __why__  you would want to 10x your performance. Use this to fuel your motivation.  

List a few activities that are most important to you. How would you evaluate your efficiency?
Break down the activities into skills and evaluate how efficient you are.

For example if you are cook here are a skills that you could evaluate to become a better cook.

* __Knife skills:__ Have you spent time on improving your knife skills?
* __Cooking techniques:__ How good is your Braising, saut√©ing, frying, baking etc.
* __Evaluate the tools you use:__ Is your knife sharp? How often do you sharpen your knife? Are you using the right pans? Do they need an upgrade?

If you are a writer (or programmer): Evaluate different aspects of the activities/skills related to your work.

* __Typing skills:__ Even though we spend a lot of time typing , many of us still use ineffective hunt and peck techniques. We could be some much more efficient if we took a little time to learn to touch type.

* __Organization of materials:__ How do you organize your materials? How streamlined is the organization of your materials. Is it easy for you to find some thing?  Do you have a good system to back up your materials?

* __Writing and publishing platform:__ If you create content in any form you should look at your end to end process for creating content and see if that if efficient.

If you need we can spend some time reviewing an  area that is of interest to you and see if we can come up with some efficiency improvements.

Have you made a list of skill/activities that you can be more efficient in? Remember why you are doing this. Do not lose touch with the WHYs? Make a plan and get started on your journey to a 10x better version of your self.

In the next post we will look at __Effectiveness__. We will also review planning and execution in future posts.
